<h1>50 DAYS OF CODE</h1>
Welcome to my 50 Days of Code challenge! Over the next 50 days, Iâ€™ll be working on a series of coding projects that will help me grow as a developer. From building interactive web pages to creating practical tools, each project is designed to boost my skills and explore new concepts. These projects range from simple to more advanced, offering hands-on experience with different types of development. My goal is to learn, improve, and share my progress while tackling a variety of real-world coding tasks.
