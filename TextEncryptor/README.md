# Text Encryptor
This project is a simple text encryption and decryption tool based on the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:
```
python3 main.py
```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts:
- Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt text by entering 1 or 2.
- Input the text you want to process.
- Provide a numeric value for the shift key (the number of positions to shift the characters).

## Example
#### Encryption:
- Input Text: `HELLO WORLD`<br>
- Shift Key: `3`<br>
- Encrypted Output: `KHOOR ZRUOG`

#### Decryption:
- Input Encrypted Text: `KHOOR ZRUOG`<br>
- Shift Key: `3`<br>
- Decrypted Output: `HELLO WORLD`
