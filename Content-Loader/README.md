# Smart Card (Content Loader)
<p>SmartCard is a responsive web application that dynamically loads content based on the user's internet connection. It provides a smooth and modern UI that adapts to different screen sizes, especially optimized for Android devices. When the device is online, the app fetches data such as images, titles, and user information. In offline mode, the user is informed of the disconnected status.</p>
