# Image Steganography
It allows users to hide text messages within images using the least significant bit (LSB) method. Users can encode a message into an image and decode it later, extracting the hidden information. This application is built using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and the Pillow library for image processing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library for image processing
- Tkinter for the GUI (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

Install the Pillow library (if not already installed):
```
pip3 install Pillow
```

## Usage
- Run the application:
```
python3 hide.py
```
- The application will open with two main buttons: Encode and Decode.
